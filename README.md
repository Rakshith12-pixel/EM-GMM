# EM-GMM
Deep generative Modeling- EM for GMM

Implementing the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to generate new images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Gaussian Mixture Model is used here, which is basically a super-position of several Gaussians with some weights. As a mixture of Gaussians is a universal density approximator, it can help learn the underlying distribution of data.
